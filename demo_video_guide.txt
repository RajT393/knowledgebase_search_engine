# Demo Video Guide: Knowledge-Base Search Engine

This guide will help you create a professional and effective demo video for your RAG-based search engine project. A good demo should be concise, clear, and highlight the key features and technical strengths of your application.

### **1. Preparation (Before Recording)**

*   **Prepare Your Environment:**
    *   Make sure your code is running without any errors.
    *   Have the FastAPI backend and Streamlit frontend running in separate terminals.
    *   Choose 2-3 interesting and diverse documents (PDFs or TXT files) to use for the demo. Good examples include:
        *   A technical paper (e.g., the original Transformer paper).
        *   A chapter from a textbook.
        *   A company's annual report.
    *   Prepare a list of 3-5 questions to ask about the documents. The questions should demonstrate the system's ability to:
        *   Extract specific facts.
        *   Synthesize information from multiple parts of a document.
        *   Answer questions that require understanding the overall context.

*   **Script Your Demo:**
    *   Write a brief script to keep your presentation focused. A good structure is:
        1.  **Introduction (15-20 seconds):** Briefly introduce yourself and the project. State the problem it solves (e.g., "This is a knowledge-base search engine that uses AI to answer questions about your documents.").
        2.  **Core Functionality (60-90 seconds):**
            *   Show the clean, empty state of the web UI.
            *   Demonstrate the file upload process. Upload your prepared documents.
            *   Show the system processing the files (if there's a visual indicator).
            *   Ask your prepared questions one by one. For each question, read the question aloud, show the generated answer, and briefly point out the source citations (if implemented).
        3.  **Technical Deep-Dive (30-45 seconds):**
            *   Briefly show your code (e.g., in VS Code) and explain the RAG architecture. You can use the diagram from your `README.md`.
            *   Mention the key technologies used (FastAPI, LangChain, FAISS, Gemini).
        4.  **Conclusion (10-15 seconds):** Summarize the project's value and thank the viewer.

### **2. Recording the Demo**

*   **Screen Recording Software:**
    *   Use a good screen recording tool like OBS Studio (free), Loom, or the built-in screen recorder in macOS/Windows.
    *   Set the recording resolution to 1080p (1920x1080) for a high-quality video.

*   **Audio:**
    *   Use a decent microphone to ensure your voice is clear. Avoid background noise.
    *   Speak clearly and at a moderate pace.

*   **Recording Flow:**
    1.  Start with the Streamlit web application open in your browser.
    2.  Follow your script to introduce the project.
    3.  Drag and drop the documents to upload them. Explain what you're doing.
    4.  Once the documents are processed, switch to the Q&A interface.
    5.  Ask your first question. Wait for the answer to appear, then read it and explain its relevance.
    6.  Repeat for your other questions.
    7.  After the Q&A part, switch to your code editor. Briefly walk through the project structure and the main components of the RAG pipeline.
    8.  End with a concluding statement.

### **3. Post-Production (Editing)**

*   **Trim the Video:** Cut out any long pauses, mistakes, or unnecessary parts.
*   **Add Titles/Annotations (Optional):** Add text overlays to highlight key features or technologies (e.g., "Powered by Google Gemini").
*   **Keep it Short:** Aim for a total video length of **2-3 minutes**. A concise demo is more impactful.

### **Example Demo Flow**

1.  **(Video Starts)** "Hi, my name is [Your Name], and this is my Knowledge-Base Search Engine."
2.  "It's a RAG-based system that lets you chat with your documents. Let's see how it works."
3.  **(Show UI)** "Here's the web interface. I'll start by uploading a research paper on AI and a financial report."
4.  **(Upload Files)** Drag and drop the files. "The system is now processing the documents, splitting them into chunks, and creating embeddings."
5.  **(Ask Question)** "Now I can ask questions. Let's start with: 'What is the main contribution of the Transformer paper?'"
6.  **(Show Answer)** "Here's the answer, synthesized from the paper. You can see it correctly identifies the attention mechanism as the key contribution."
7.  **(Ask Another Question)** "Now let's ask about the financial report: 'What was the company's total revenue in the last fiscal year?'"
8.  **(Show Answer)** "And here's the exact revenue figure, pulled directly from the report."
9.  **(Switch to Code)** "Under the hood, the project uses a FastAPI backend and the LangChain library to implement the RAG pipeline. It uses FAISS for the vector store and Google's Gemini model for answer generation."
10. **(Conclusion)** "This project demonstrates a powerful and scalable way to build a private search engine. Thank you for watching!"
